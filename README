= Tinymce Filter =

This extension provides a TinyMCE filter for the Radiant CMS. 
It allows you to edit the content of your pages in the TinyMCE editor.
We now have image uploading (mostly snatched from glorious Community Engine)!



== Installation ==

  
  # Download master from git hub using git or tarball download:
  
  git://github.com/miv/radiant_tinymce_filter/tree/master.git
  
  
  # Copy tinymce with radiant_tags plugin to your /public directory by invoking

  rake radiant:extensions:tinymce_filter:update

== Settings ==

If you want to change the settings of the editor, you can do this by editing the 'tiny_mce_settings.js' file in your /public/javascripts/extentions/tiny_mce folder. 

The 'radiant_tags' plugin is used to protect the Radiant tags from being destroyed by the editor. It will not hide your <r:> tags, instead it will preserve it from being sanitazied.

== Image uploading

Image uploading uses paperclip, so you need to install it first. Also respond_to_parents plugin needed. If you already have some assets  processing (maybe on attachments_fu) then all you need to do is to:
1) Patch photos model
2) Patch javascript/extenstions/tiny_mce/plugins/curblyadvimage/image.html in line:
  <input class="input-file" id="image_uploaded_data" name="photo[photo]" size="30" type="file"/>
  you need to change name to whatever you want (photo[uploaded_data] in case of attachments_fu).
3) Patch views in lines where it uses paperclip's photo.url(:thumb) on photo.public_filename
4) Patch controller to do the same
5) Patch function select_thumb(element) (javascript/extenstions/tiny_mce/plugins/curblyadvimage/functions.js) to generate correct urls
  

== A word of warning

TinyMCE did't want to work when i tried to put multiple instances of it on one page, so now it is destroying every time you switch a tab. I don't feel any discomfort on my machine but still...

I had to patch radiant TabControl javascript class to add callbacks before and after you switch tabs. Right now it's dead simple and cannot work with multiple callbacks. Also it has logic of 'select' method of TabControll class, so if after update of your radiant copy somthing affilated with tabs break, this filter is first place to look at (look at public\javascripts\extensions\tiny_mce\tiny_mce_radiant_tabcontrol_extension.js)
